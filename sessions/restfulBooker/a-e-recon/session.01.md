# \[Explore Restful Booker to Discover What's Interesting\]

**Time Box** \[15\] minutes

**Site Used For Testing** \[https://automationintesting.online/\]

## Context

_Optional_ - We are not used Restful Booker before so we are looking for interesting risks to explore more deeply

## Notes

* We are able to book rooms in the past
* There seem to be length limits for phone number - other constraints
* Selecting booking nights was confusing (click and drag rather than just click start and end - no feedback on clicking) - and means you can't book for a single night
* First name & last name on booking has constraints - must be 3 - ? chars - problem for people with last name "Ho" or "Wu"
* There is validation on bookings - worth exploring more
* There is no validation for the message fields until you hit submit - no indication of what's required


## Follow Ups

* Usability expectations? Usability testing?
* Phone number restrictions & error messages
